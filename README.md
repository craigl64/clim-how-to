This repository contains the source files for a book about building
applications in Common Lisp using the CLIM interface system.

It is written in TexInfo format so you will need the TexInfo
documentation building programs from GNU.

All diagrams are created in Dot files so you will also need the Dot
processing programs from Graphiz.
