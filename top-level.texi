@node clim Introduction
@chapter Introduction

CLIM is an acronym that stands for Common Lisp Interface Manager.

CLIM takes your object oriented application and gives it a very powerful
interface.  It takes the objects that make up your application and makes
them part of the interface.

The basic idea is that you define an Application Frame with some number
of Panes in it and then present objects into those panes.  You define
commands on the frame and presentation actions that do things when the
presented objects are clicked.
